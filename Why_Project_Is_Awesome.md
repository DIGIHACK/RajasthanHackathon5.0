The first thing tourists do, whenever they decide to tour a place, is to learn about that place from various online sources like travelling websites, the official website of the government of that state, or country, and by reading reviews of people that have toured the place before. Usually for all this research, a person has to visit a large number of websites and that can be mind-baffling and frustrating for some people.
So here, I have tried to make a portal that’ll give all the specific information about the tourist places of Rajasthan (like travel routes, nearby police stations, ATMs, hospitals, fire brigade station etc). After this portal is made live, the tourists will now have to visit only one website for all of his related research work.

Following are some of the salient features of my product:

1)	This project demonstration involves the use of 'HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, JSON, BootStrap, Modern Day CSS Grid, Flexbox System and Google Maps and a Live Weather API'.

2)	The official tourism website of Rajasthan Government is not SEO friendly, and is often neglected for the adsense purpose. My product is SEO friendly and so by using adsense and other advertisement friendly things, the website will rank first on the Google search results. This will also raise revenue from the website.

3)	After subscribing to the newsletter service, the user will keep getting information about the state tourist places and other news and current affairs related to the state. This will help in creating a good impression of the state in front of tourists.

4)	Also, once a user registers to the website, he will now become eligible to write about his journey experience of the website, which will then be read by millions of people around the world. This will help the tourists that look out for other people’s opinions on the internet, before making a decision.

5)	Direct official communication links of the social media profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+ etc ) of the Government of Rajasthan will be provided as a sticker on the website, so that the tourists don’t have to search here and there for some official response.

6)	Each tourist place or the fort will have a dedicated webpage, that’ll be designed specifically for them.
The dedicated webpage will have a unique maps feature that will automatically locate the tourist's present location and will then guide him to reach their destination tourist place. Such informative pages will be created for every tourist places and forts of Rajasthan.
This will take help of a database that will contain the information of all the Police Stations, Hospitals, ATMs, Post Offices, Hotels and other such helpline numbers like the local fire brigade etc.                              
After this, the website will be developed in a way that it starts displaying the location of all the nearby police stations, hospitals, ATMs etc to the tourist (extracting latitude and longitude from the Google Maps API).

7)	Other than all of this, brief information about Bus Routes, Auto Routes, and Railway Routes will also be displayed to the tourists, so that they don't have to face any difficulty in finding the most suitable correct travelling route for them and their acquaintances.

8)	The website has been made extremely aesthetic and eye pleasing. Beautiful website for the beautiful state called Rajasthan.
