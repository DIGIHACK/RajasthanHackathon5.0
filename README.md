This project involves the use of 'HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, JSON, BootStrap, Modern Day CSS Grid, Flexbox System and Google Maps and a Live Weather API.

I have created three files for this project. The first one is named web2.html. And this is the main page of the website.

The second file is named weather.html. You can see the live version of that project by going on my codepen id                             ( https://codepen.io/sanchit0496/full/ZxLRoG/ ), in case the API doesn't respond well on your computer. It gives the present latitude and longitude of the location of the device, as well as several weather conditions like humidity, widn speed, minimum temperature, maximum temperature etc. Using the latitude and longitude, a person can spot his position and can prevent himself from getting lost.

The third file is named info.html. This file contains information about the Chittorgarh fort. The history of chittorgarh, the tourism at chittorgarh, the fairs and festivals, and how to reach that place. The unique maps feature will automatically locate your location and will then guide you to reach the place. Such informative pages will be created for every tourist places and forts.

I am also creating a database, that will have the information of all the police stations, hospitals, ATMs, Post Offices, Hotels and other such helpline numbers.
After this, the website will be designed in such a way that all the police stations, hospitals and other such facilites will automatically get displayed to the tourist, once he enters into the proximity area of any one of them.

Information about Bus Routes, Auto Routes, and Railway Routes will also be displayed to the tourist, so that he doesn't have to face any difficulty in finding the most suitable correct traveling route.
